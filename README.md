# Video Extensions
A (comprehensive) list of video file extensions. This list of video extensions has lots of obscure, rarely used, and proprietary video formats. (Some of which share extensions with more common file formats. Ex. `.ts`) This list is more likely to cause false-positives than a less comprehensive list. (Like [video-extensions](https://github.com/sindresorhus/video-extensions) by Sindre Sorhus)

## Install
```
$ npm install --save video-extensions-list
```

## Usage Example
```js
